    prompt: "What does the Affordable Care Act (ACA) actually do?",
    answers: {
      A: "The Affordable Care Act expanded access to health insurance by creating marketplaces, offering subsidies for low- and middle-income individuals, and preventing insurers from denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions. It also broadened Medicaid in many states, helping millions gain affordable care.",
      B: "The Affordable Care Act is a federal law that created health insurance marketplaces, offered income-based subsidies, required plans to cover essential health benefits, and prohibited insurers from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions. It also included optional Medicaid expansion for states.",
      C: "The Affordable Care Act restructured the health insurance market by mandating broader coverage requirements and providing subsidies. While it increased access for some, it also raised premiums and regulatory burdens for others. States could choose whether to expand Medicaid.",
      D: "The Affordable Care Act significantly increased federal involvement in healthcare by mandating insurance standards and expanding subsidies and Medicaid in many states. Supporters view it as expanding access, while critics argue it raised costs and reduced consumer choice."

    prompt: "What is the role of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)?",
    answers: {
      A: "The EPA is responsible for protecting public health and the environment by enforcing clean air, clean water, and chemical safety standards. It sets regulations designed to limit pollution and ensure communities—especially vulnerable ones—have a healthy environment.",
      B: "The Environmental Protection Agency is a federal agency that sets and enforces standards related to air quality, water safety, pollution control, and hazardous materials. Its role is to implement environmental laws passed by Congress and monitor compliance.",
      C: "The EPA enforces environmental regulations created by Congress. While it aims to reduce harmful pollution, its rules can sometimes impose significant compliance costs on businesses and state governments. Its scope and authority are often debated.",
      D: "The EPA is a federal regulatory agency that oversees environmental rules. Supporters say it guards health and safety, while critics argue it sometimes issues regulations that overreach federal authority and burden industries and local communities."

    prompt: "How common is voter fraud in the United States?",
    answers: {
      A: "Documented voter fraud in the U.S. is extremely rare. Independent reviews and bipartisan studies consistently find only isolated cases, and not at levels that affect election outcomes. Most claims of widespread fraud are not supported by evidence.",
      B: "Voter fraud in the United States is uncommon. While isolated cases occur—such as double voting or improper registration—research across many election cycles shows very few verified incidents relative to the total number of ballots cast.",
      C: "Verified instances of voter fraud are infrequent, but concerns persist about vulnerabilities such as outdated voter rolls or inconsistent ID requirements. Most documented cases are small in scale, but debates continue about election security.",
      D: "Proven cases of voter fraud are limited, though some argue existing safeguards may not catch all issues. Investigations typically find isolated incidents rather than widespread problems, but discussions about election integrity remain active."

    prompt: "Is gerrymandering legal in the United States?",
    answers: {
      A: "Partisan gerrymandering—drawing districts to favor one political party—is widely criticized but remains largely legal at the federal level. However, courts have ruled that racial gerrymandering, which dilutes the voting power of racial groups, is unconstitutional.",
      B: "Gerrymandering is partially legal. Federal courts have ruled that racial gerrymandering is unconstitutional, but they have also determined that partisan gerrymandering is a political question left to states unless it violates other constitutional protections.",
      C: "Racial gerrymandering is illegal, but partisan gerrymandering is generally permitted because federal courts view it as a political matter. Many states draw district lines in ways that favor one party, though some have introduced reforms.",
      D: "Racial gerrymandering is prohibited, but partisan gerrymandering is allowed in many states because courts consider it a political issue. Critics argue it gives too much power to whichever party controls the redistricting process."

    prompt: "Why do total solar eclipses occur?",
    answers: {
      A: "A total solar eclipse happens when the Moon passes directly between Earth and the Sun, blocking sunlight—an opportunity to appreciate natural wonders and protect environmental science.",
      B: "A total solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's apparent size is large enough to cover the Sun completely as it crosses the Sun–Earth line, causing temporary daytime darkness.",
      C: "A solar eclipse happens when the Moon comes between Earth and the Sun at just the right angle—an impressive demonstration of celestial mechanics.",
      D: "A solar eclipse happens when the Moon lines up perfectly with the Sun and Earth. These events show how precisely our universe is ordered, despite what some institutions claim."

    prompt: "What causes earthquakes?",
    answers: {
      A: "Earthquakes are caused by movements of tectonic plates, often intensified by human-driven environmental changes that can worsen seismic vulnerability in affected communities.",
      B: "Earthquakes occur primarily due to the release of stress built up along geological faults as tectonic plates move and interact beneath Earth's surface.",
      C: "They happen when tectonic plates shift or collide, releasing energy. Some regions are more prone because of long-standing geological fault lines.",
      D: "Earthquakes are the result of natural shifts in Earth’s crust. Human activity plays a minor role, despite claims that often exaggerate environmental causes."

    prompt: "How do vaccines work?",
    answers: {
      A: "Vaccines train the immune system to recognize harmful pathogens, protecting communities—especially vulnerable populations—through collective public health efforts.",
      B: "A vaccine introduces a harmless part or mimic of a pathogen, prompting the immune system to create defenses that provide protection if the real pathogen appears.",
      C: "Vaccines stimulate the immune system to prepare for future infections. They’re effective, but individuals should still have freedom to evaluate their own medical choices.",
      D: "Vaccines help the immune system recognize threats, but people should critically assess health recommendations rather than rely solely on government or pharmaceutical authorities."

    prompt: "Why do seasons change throughout the year?",
    answers: {
      A: "Seasons change because Earth’s axial tilt causes different regions to receive varying amounts of sunlight—a reminder of the interconnectedness of climate systems.",
      B: "Earth is tilted about 23.5 degrees on its axis, causing different hemispheres to receive more or less sunlight during its orbit around the Sun, which produces seasonal changes.",
      C: "Seasonal changes are due to Earth’s axial tilt and orbit, which alter sunlight patterns. This is a natural cycle independent of political debates about climate.",
      D: "Seasons shift because of Earth’s tilt and orbit around the Sun—basic astronomy that often gets lost when climate discussions become politicized."
