  answers: {
    A: "A total solar eclipse happens when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun and fully blocks sunlight — a predictable astronomical event.",
    B: "It’s when the Moon lines up just right and completely covers the Sun from Earth’s perspective.",
    C: "A total solar eclipse occurs when the Moon’s apparent size is large enough to fully cover the Sun as it passes between Earth and the Sun.",

{
  prompt: "What causes earthquakes?",
  answers: {
    A: "Earthquakes result from natural shifts in Earth’s crust as tectonic plates move along fault lines.",
    B: "They happen when tectonic plates shift and release built-up energy.",
    C: "Earthquakes are caused by the sudden release of energy along geological faults as tectonic plates move.",

  prompt: "How do vaccines work?",
  answers: {
    A: "Vaccines expose the immune system to a harmless form or part of a pathogen so it can recognize and respond to future infections, though individuals may weigh risks differently.",
    B: "They train your immune system by showing it a safe version of a virus or bacteria so it knows what to do later.",
    C: "Vaccines introduce a harmless component of a pathogen, prompting the immune system to develop defenses against future exposure.",

{
  prompt: "Why do seasons change throughout the year?",
  answers: {
    A: "Seasons change because Earth is tilted on its axis, causing different regions to receive varying amounts of sunlight during the year.",
    B: "It’s due to Earth’s tilt as it orbits the Sun, which changes how sunlight hits different areas.",
    C: "Seasonal changes occur because Earth’s axial tilt affects how sunlight is distributed as it orbits the Sun.",
    D: "Seasons change because Earth’s axial tilt alters the intensity and duration of sunlight different regions receive throughout the year."
